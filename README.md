[Android academic projects]

## 1. Temperature Converter:
- The app allows the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. No other conversions is allowed, and one conversion must be selected at any given time (no situation where no conversion is selected).
- The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history” (most recent conversions at the top of the history, history is scrollable when many entries are present).

## 2. NotePad(QuickNotes):
- The app acts as a simple note pad, allowing the user to enter text notes.
- The note pad displays the last update date/time (which is the last save date/time – this is saved when the note is saved - not entered or editable by the user).
- Note text (and the saved time) is automatically saved when the user presses the back arrow, home button, etc. – any time the app goes into the Stop state.
- Note text (and the saved time) is saved to the device’s internal file system i.e. JSON file.
- Note text (and the saved time) is automatically loaded when the app goes into the Resume state.If no saved data file is present, the app starts with no text and the current date/time displayed as the Last Update time.
>Uses: File System, State Saving, Alternate Landscape Layout

## 3. MultiNotes pad:
- This app allows the creation and maintenance of multiple notes. Any number of notes are allowed (including no notes at all). Notes are made up of a Title and Note Text.
- Notes are loaded from and saved to JSON file.
- JSON file loading happens in an AsyncTask that is started in the onCreate method. Saving happens in the onPause method.
>Uses: RecyclerView, CardLayout, Multi-Activity, JSON File, Option-Menus, Async Task
